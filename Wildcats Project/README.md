# SPRINT 3 - Wildcats

## Our Project

We are editing the documentation, specifically adding instructions for several main types of operating systems (Ubuntu, Fedora, Mac OS X, and Amazon Linux). You can find our actual work under *"augur/docs/"* - the actual source information we've edited is within *"source/getting-started"*, although our build is within the *"build"* zip in this folder.

## Things That Changed in Sprint 3

- This folder: we've added some more documents.
- We've finalized the Amazon Linux guide.
- We've added macOS's guide and begun work on the Ubuntu guide.
- A build of the current form of our documentation can also be found in the zip file in this folder.
