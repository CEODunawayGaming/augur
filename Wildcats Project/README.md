# SPRINT 4 - Wildcats

## Our Project

We are editing the documentation, specifically adding instructions for several main types of operating systems (Ubuntu, Fedora, Mac OS X, and Amazon Linux). You can find our actual work under *"augur/docs/"* - the actual source information we've edited is within *"source/getting-started"*, although our build is within the *"build"* zip in this folder.

## Things That Changed in Sprint 4

- This folder: we've added some more documents.
- We've finalized all our guides.
- A build of the current form of our documentation can also be found in the zip file in this folder.

## Issues We Ran Into

- We could not get augur to build on Fedora. The Table of Contents page makes it explicitly clear that we do not recommend using Fedora. We listed out the dependencies and commands just like the other OSes, but we made a note of the `make install` not finishing.
